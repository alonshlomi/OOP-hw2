# Ex2

In this assignment we implements data structure, algorithms and GUI for further assignments.  
In this assignment we represent data structure of directed weighted graph.  
We implemented algorithms like finding shortest path between nodes, connectivity of the graph and path of group of nodes.

### Node Class

This class represents the set of operations applicable on a node (vertex) in a (directional) weighted graph.  

### Edge Class

This class represents the set of operations applicable on a directional edge(src,dest) in a (directional) weighted graph.   

### DGraph Class

This class represents a directional weighted graph.  

### Graph_Algo Class

 This class represents the "regular" Graph Theory algorithms including:
 * Clone graph. 
 * Init graph. 
 * Save graph. 
 * Connectivity of the graph. 
 * Shortest path between 2 nodes. 

##### Libraries

In this project we used Gson library for reading a json file.  
[Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)
